# AI Enablement

Welcome to the AI Enablement workshop repo, here you will find prompts, configs and 
links to CustomGPTs that will be used throughout the session. We have a fantastic session planned 
with 80% of your time spent experimenting (FAFO) and exploring the various tools and methods. 
Theory is kept to a minimum. No technical (Einstein) knowledge is required. 
This is not a typing class, I'm here to help, so lean in and engage.

🚨🚨🚨 **ALERT** 🚨🚨🚨

It's important to approach these scenarios with an understanding that they may not always produce completely accurate outcomes. 
- In some instances, achieving absolute accuracy might not be feasible. 
- Remember, the assistance provided by AI is a tool to support your decision-making process, not to replace it. 
- Your discression is crucial. 
- Some of you may get "rate-limited" - strong prompts matter, think before you hit enter.
- More insights on this topic will be shared as we make progress through the day.
