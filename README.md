### 🚨 Important Notice 🚨

As we dive into AI tools, keep in mind:

- ⚠️ Some results may lack complete accuracy. Striving for perfect precision might not always be feasible.
- 💡 Use AI as a support tool to enhance decision-making rather than replace it.
- ⚙️ Prompt quality matters – think carefully before hitting "enter" to avoid potential "rate-limits."

## 🦾 Chapter 1: Recent Updates and CustomGPTs (60 minutes)

This chapter introduces recent developments in AI, including **ChatGPT Canvas** and **Claude Artifacts**, which provide powerful tools for strategy development. We’ll start with a **team exercise** to create a prompt for an **F25 Charter** focused on food waste reduction.

### Objectives for Chapter 1
- **Create a Strategy**: Using ChatGPT Canvas, write a roadmap for food waste reduction, including KPIs to align with organizational goals. We'll review this in Claude Artifacts too.
- **Experiment with CustomGPTs**: Use ChatGPT to create a CustomGPT - your very own app.
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Develop a prompt for a detailed F25 Charter, defining clear steps to reduce waste and establish measurable KPIs.

## 🚀 Chapter 2: UI and Agents (60 minutes)

In this chapter, we’ll use the **v0.dev platform** to transform the F25 Charter prompt into an interactive **dashboard**. We'll discuss **data visualization** techniques, build the foundation of a real-time dashboard, and explore **AI Agents** and their role in data processing.

### Objectives for Chapter 2
- **Dashboard Building**: Using the F25 Charter prompt, we’ll craft a dashboard in v0.dev.
- **Explore Agents**: Learn about the importance of AI Agents, what they are, and how they can automate tasks and improve efficiency.
- **Practical Application**: Design and deploy a dashboard that tracks KPIs in real-time, ensuring the organization stays aligned with the food waste reduction goals.

#### Topics
- 🖥️ **Dashboard Creation**: Build a live dashboard from the F25 Charter prompt using v0.dev.
- 🔍 **Data Agents**: Introduction to data agents, discussing their use and potential for automation.
- 🤖 **Practical Tips**: Understand best practices for integrating agents with dashboard analytics.

## 📊 Chapter 3: Automations and NO/LO Code (60 minutes)

In our final chapter, we’ll take the UI and code from v0.dev and push it into **Replit**, **GPT Engineer**, and **CLINE** to build a functional, interactive dashboard. This is where we bring the entire process together, showcasing the power of **no-code/low-code platforms** for scalable automation.

### Objectives for Chapter 3
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Implement the F25 Charter dashboard across Replit, GPT Engineer, and CLINE.
- **Automation**: Explore low-code/no-code automation for real-world applications.
- **Final Hands-on Exercise**: Deploy the completed dashboard and understand how automation can streamline organizational objectives.

#### Topics
- ⚙️ **Replit**: Transfer code and UI to Replit for further development.
- 🧑‍💻 **GPT Engineer & CLINE**: Integrate with GPT Engineer and CLINE to refine and automate the dashboard’s functions.
- 📈 **Final Dashboard Launch**: Build a fully functional, automated dashboard that aligns with the F25 Charter goals.
