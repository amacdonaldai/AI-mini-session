### 🚨 Important Notice 🚨

As we dive into AI tools, keep in mind:

- ⚠️ Some results may lack complete accuracy. Striving for perfect precision might not always be feasible.
- 💡 Use AI as a support tool to enhance decision-making rather than replace it.
- ⚙️ Prompt quality matters – think carefully before hitting "enter" to avoid potential "rate-limits."

## 🦾 Chapter 1: Recent Updates and CustomGPTs (60 minutes)

This chapter introduces recent developments in AI, including **ChatGPT Canvas** and **Claude Artifacts**, which provide powerful tools for strategy development. We’ll start with a **team exercise** to create a prompt for an **F25 Charter** focused on food waste reduction.

### Objectives for Chapter 1
- **Create a Strategy**: Using ChatGPT Canvas, write a roadmap for food waste reduction, including KPIs to align with organizational goals. We'll review this in Claude Artifacts too.
- **Experiment with CustomGPTs**: Use ChatGPT to create a CustomGPT - your very own app.
- **Hands-on Exercise**: Develop a prompt for a detailed F25 Charter, defining clear steps to reduce waste and establish measurable KPIs.

### F25 Charter Prompt for Second Harvest

**Prompt:**

**Role**: Act as an expert strategic planner and advisor for Second Harvest, focused on sustainability and organizational alignment.

**Task**: Develop an organization-wide F25 Charter to help align and focus the Second Harvest team on the roadmap to reduce food waste. This charter should serve as a guiding document, keeping everyone at Second Harvest aligned and accountable to shared goals.

**Function**: The charter should include the following key sections:

1. **Areas of Focus**: Outline the primary areas where Second Harvest should concentrate efforts to effectively reduce food waste. Each area should be clearly defined and tied to Second Harvest’s overall mission of minimizing food waste and maximizing food security.

2. **Strategic Pillars**: Establish a set of strategic pillars that will form the foundation of Second Harvest’s food waste reduction efforts. These pillars should ensure cohesion, support cross-departmental initiatives, and drive the overall strategy.

3. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Define specific and measurable KPIs for each area of focus, allowing Second Harvest to track progress and success. These KPIs should reflect the organization’s commitment to reducing food waste across various departments and operational levels, including both quarterly and annual milestones.

**Outcome**: The charter should be clear, actionable, and inspiring for Second Harvest. It should promote accountability, foster collaboration across departments, and provide a structured approach to monitoring progress toward the F25 roadmap goals.

## 🚀 Chapter 2: UI and Agents (60 minutes)

In this chapter, we’ll use the **v0.dev platform** to transform the F25 Charter prompt into an interactive **dashboard**. We'll discuss **data visualization** techniques, build the foundation of a real-time dashboard, and explore **AI Agents** and their role in data processing.

### Objectives for Chapter 2
- **Dashboard Building**: Using the F25 Charter prompt, we’ll craft a dashboard in v0.dev.
- **Explore Agents**: Learn about the importance of AI Agents, what they are, and how they can automate tasks and improve efficiency.
- **Practical Application**: Design and deploy a dashboard that tracks KPIs in real-time, ensuring the organization stays aligned with the food waste reduction goals.

#### Topics
- 🖥️ **Dashboard Creation**: Build a live dashboard from the F25 Charter prompt using v0.dev.
- 🔍 **Data Agents**: Introduction to data agents, discussing their use and potential for automation.
- 🤖 **Practical Tips**: Understand best practices for integrating agents with dashboard analytics.

## 📊 Chapter 3: Automations and NO/LO Code (60 minutes)

In our final chapter, we’ll take the UI and code from v0.dev and push it into **Replit**, **GPT Engineer**, and **CLINE** to build a functional, interactive dashboard. This is where we bring the entire process together, showcasing the power of **no-code/low-code platforms** for scalable automation.

### Objectives for Chapter 3
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Implement the F25 Charter dashboard across Replit, GPT Engineer, and CLINE.
- **Automation**: Explore low-code/no-code automation for real-world applications.
- **Final Hands-on Exercise**: Deploy the completed dashboard and understand how automation can streamline organizational objectives.

#### Topics
- ⚙️ **Replit**: Transfer code and UI to Replit for further development.
- 🧑‍💻 **GPT Engineer & CLINE**: Integrate with GPT Engineer and CLINE to refine and automate the dashboard’s functions.
- 📈 **Final Dashboard Launch**: Build a fully functional, automated dashboard that aligns with the F25 Charter goals.
